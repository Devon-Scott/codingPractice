Cracking the Coding Interview, Codility Lessons, and Leetcode Practice

I am using this repository to practice data structures and algorithms<br>
through Cracking the Coding Interview, Codility Lessons, and Leetcode.<br>
I use multiple devices depending on where I am and wanted easy access<br>
to the problems I work on, so I decided to use git to do so
